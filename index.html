          <h2>Hello üëãüèΩ</h2>
          <p>
            I am Nazia Nusrat Ima. I would describe myself as hard working, passionate and dedicated individual.
            My goal is to establish myself as one of the most demanding Web and Micro Service Developer in 
            the next 3 years. My interest in Web development came from experience learning to design and build my
            own personal Web site. It is an outlet that allowed me to combine computer skills and creativity.
            I want to go out of my way to go over the top and surprise myself at the end of every projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me being positive is NOT pretending that everything is good, it is SEEING the good in everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            My message to people is that be silly, be fun, be different, be crazy. Because life is to short to be
            anything but yourself and happy.

          <p>
            This application I built is a blog style web application where different users can write different 
            posts and share their views on various subjects. These posts can be blog posts or twitter updates.
             I choose this project, so that People can get information like Awareness of Environment issues 
             or any other issues related to education, health, digital technology by the help of this Website.
             Any User can share any information related to any topic to all Users.  
            I have used mainly Python and Django framework. Django is a popular python framework that gives 
            us a lot of functionalities right out of the box and makes it really enjoyable to work with 
            web applications.
             Bootstrap4 and HTML are also used to build this web application.

          <p>
            The project is all about making use of computers for the admission of the people in a course rather than doing it manually. 
            This system provides the way to get admission easily and efficiently. 
            In short, it reduces the paper work and also keeps the records of information of the students safe.

          <h2>IOT Based Online Monitoring System For Transformer</h2>
          <p>
            Power Transformer is the main component of electric power distribution. Therefore monitoring transformer
            health and conditions has immense importance. The main objective of the project is to monitoring the
            condition of power transformer located from remote location. For this purpose the four main criteria of
            transformer which are Voltage, current, temperature & oil level of the transformer has been taken. To
            achieve the goal, this project was implemented by using Arduino, GSM module, & Arduino compatible Ethernet
            shield. If any one of the parameter i.e. voltage, current, temperature & oil level crossed their threshold,
            will be notified by SMS using Arduino and GSM module. Similarly same data will be uploaded to a server for
            online monitoring using Arduino & Ethernet shield.

          <h2>Intelligent Greenhouse</h2>
          <p>
            Green house is the most convenient way to achieve sustainable food production. This is the design of a
            sensor network that provides real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, level of carbon dioxide, light
            intensity and soil moisture of a greenhouse. An automated control system for managing these micro-climate
            parameters is developed to optimize the parameters. The sensor node developed handles the data from the
            sensors and triggers actuators based on the threshold algorithm programmed into the microcontroller. The
            gateway receives the sensor data and control information through Arduino Mega and transmits the data to the
            actuators for remote monitoring. The monitor software provides network view with nodes and their
            information. Information management system is also designed to monitor the data at any required time.

          <h2>Bluetooth Controlled Home Automation System</h2>
          <p>
            Automation system in home is an exciting field of work, where new technology and technique is required on a
            regular basis. There are loads of methods to implement a home automation system. But every method has common
            term and that is wireless control. Wireless control can be achieved in several ways like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi
            etc. But everything above, a computer is necessary to make all of this happen. In this project a miniature
            computer has been used i.e. microcontroller (arduino). This is programmable according to user requirements.
            And can be modified even after implementation. This project shows an implementation
            microcontroller-Bluetooth based system which can be controlled by an android phone. The communication
            between the cell phone and the Arduino BT board which is wireless.
